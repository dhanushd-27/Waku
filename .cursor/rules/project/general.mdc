# General Project Standards

## Core Principles

- Use TypeScript everywhere
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- One primary responsibility per file
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency across the codebase

## Code Quality

- Write self-documenting code through clear naming
- Keep functions and components focused and small
- Avoid premature optimization
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

## TypeScript Standards

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define explicit types for function parameters and returns
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` or proper types instead
- Use type inference where it improves readability
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/intersections

## File Organization

- Group related files by feature/domain
- Use kebab-case for file and folder names
- Keep related code together
- Separate concerns (UI, logic, data)

## Testing

- Write tests for complex logic
- Test user-facing functionality
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use descriptive test names

## Documentation

- Document exported APIs (components, functions, hooks)
- Explain non-obvious decisions and tradeoffs
- Keep documentation up to date
- Prefer code clarity over comments

## Performance

- Optimize for user experience
- Consider bundle size
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Profile before optimizing

## Security

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate user input
- Sanitize data before rendering
- Follow security best practices

## Notes

- These are general guidelines - refer to specific rule files for detailed standards
- When in doubt, follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
