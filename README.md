## Waku

Waku is an image resizing tool designed to help you post your full pictures on Instagram, X (Twitter), and WhatsApp without worrying about your images being cropped.

### The Problem

Have you ever posted a picture on social media only to find that important parts of your image got cut off? This happens because different platforms have specific aspect ratio requirements, and when your image doesn't match, the platform automatically crops it—often cutting out the most important parts of your photo.

### The Solution

Waku solves this by resizing your images to match the exact aspect ratios required by Instagram, X, and WhatsApp. Instead of cropping your image, Waku adds smart borders that preserve your entire picture while ensuring it fits perfectly on your chosen platform. No more lost details, no more awkward crops—just your complete image, beautifully formatted.

### Features
